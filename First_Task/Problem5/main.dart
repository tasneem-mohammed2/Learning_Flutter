/*For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and  
be able to find that information based on their name.
Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run  
your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the  
birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something  
like this:
 
>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of: 
Albert Einstein 
Benjamin Franklin 
Ada Lovelace 
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up? 
Benjamin Franklin 
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706*/
